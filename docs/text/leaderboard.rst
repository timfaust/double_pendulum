Leaderboards
============

As there are wildly different control methods it is very interesting to compare
and rate their motions to better understand their behavior.

This repository features three leaderboards to compare control methods:

* Simulation Leaderboard
* Robustness Leaderboard
* Real Hardware Leaderboard

The official leaderboards can be found at
`official leaderboards <https://dfki-ric-underactuated-lab.github.io/real_ai_gym_leaderboard/>`__ 
The repository is periodically checked for new controllers and the leaderboard is updated.
For further information and instructions on how to evaluate your own controller
see the linked descriptions.
